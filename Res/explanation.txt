This folder contains different results from running the code.

Some important files:

	periodogramRes.txt 		- contains results from running the periodogram algorithm on each packet from each transmission for every device
							its important to note that the periodogram gives us the dominant cycles of the transmissions, we are keeping the most dominant cycle
							the entries show the dominant cycle value and the number of times it has appeared from all of the packets from that single transmission

	periodogramResClean.txt - contains the same as above but with most of the text removed
	
	dayVals.txt 			- contains the most dominant cycle value over all packets and transmission for the day for every device over all 3 days

# RF-TimeSeries-Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to try to use time series algorithms and methods to assist in the identification of devices based on their raw transmissions.

## Files
`timeSeriesHelper.py` is the main file of use, as it provides helpful functionality such as reading in IQ files, identifying packets within a transmission, displaying the autocorrelation, and creating a periodogram from the data
